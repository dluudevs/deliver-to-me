1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your
solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test
then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

  - I spent 7.5 hours on this coding assignment. If I had more time, I would make the UI a little nicer and find a cleaner approach to manage form state.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your
chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used
it.
  - Optional chaining is a great addition. I used it here: restaurants?.length ? showResults() : showLoading()

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever
had to do this?
  - I have never had to do this. I think if i had to, I would start by looking at the network and sources tab in the chrome dev tools. I try not to repeat any code or repeat expensive function calls

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?
  - It doesn't have a lot of data for some cities like Markham, I would start by adding more results to cities in the GTA

5. Please describe yourself using JSON.

<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
