1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your
solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test
then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

  - I spent 6.5 hours on this coding assignment. If I had more time, I would make the UI a little nicer and write more tests.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your
chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used
it.
  - Optional chaining is a great addition. I used it here: restaurants?.length ? showResults() : showLoading()

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever
had to do this?
  - I have never had to do this. I think if i had to, I would start by looking at the network and sources tab in the chrome dev tools. I try not to repeat any code or repeat expensive function calls

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?
  - It doesn't have a lot of data for some cities like Markham, I would start by adding more results to cities in the GTA

5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
